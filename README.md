# Mapping-Web
I Created a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from the available data set based on their longitude and latitude.

   * The data markers is reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appears larger and darker in color.

   * Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.

   * A legend is created that will provide context for the map data.
